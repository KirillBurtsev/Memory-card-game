# Memory-card-game
Simple game using Swift and UIKit
### Project: Concentration Game

This iOS project is a simple memory card game built using Swift and UIKit. The game challenges players to match pairs of cards with identical emojis by flipping them over.

#### Features:

- **Dynamic Card Generation:** Cards are dynamically generated with random emoji pairs from a predefined collection.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players can flip cards by tapping on them to reveal emojis and attempt to match pairs.
- **Touch Counter:** The game keeps track of the number of touches made by the player, providing feedback on their progress.

#### Implementation Details:

- The `ViewController` class manages the game logic and user interface.
- A `ConcentrationGame` instance handles the game mechanics, including card matching and state management.
- Emojis are randomly assigned to cards from a collection, ensuring variability in each game session.
- The user interface is updated dynamically to reflect changes in the game state, such as flipped or matched cards.
